## üîë API Setup

1. Go to [TheMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new API key from your account settings.
3. Add your API key to the project:
   
   - Open the project in Xcode.
   - Locate `Config.swift` or the appropriate file where the API keys are stored.
   - Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:
     ```swift
     let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
     ```

## üîß Configuration

You can configure the following settings:

- **Image Quality**: The app loads high-resolution images from the TMDB API by default. You can adjust the resolution by changing the base image URL.

## üß© Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and testability.

- **Model**: Holds the data retrieved from TMDB API.
- **View**: The UI layer built using SwiftUI.
- **ViewModel**: Responsible for fetching data and business logic.

## üóÉÔ∏è API Usage

The app uses the following endpoints of TheMovieDatabase API:

- **Trending Movies**: `/trending/movie/week`
- **Search Movies**: `/search/movie`
- **Movie Details**: `/movie/{movie_id}`
- **Movie Images**: `/movie/{movie_id}/images`
- **Movie Cast**: `/movie/{movie_id}/credits`
